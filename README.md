# Decision Tree Classifier

A Python-based project to build, train, and evaluate a Decision Tree Classifier for predicting outcomes based on input data. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization using Scikit-learn.

---

## Features
- Load and preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical features).
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier with Scikit-learn.
- Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize the decision tree structure to interpret feature importance and splits.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
